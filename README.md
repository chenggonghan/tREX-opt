# tREX-opt

tREX (Park, J. and Lin, S. (2016)) is a model-based method to construct 3D structure from Hi-C matrix which takes dependency of Hi-C data into consideration and addresses the excessive zero issues. However, its computational cost is very expensive.Here we propose tREX-opt, a 3D structure recapitulation method to combine the advantages from both modeling-based and optimization-based approaches.
